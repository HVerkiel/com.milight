// Important Notes:
//*   Instead of providing the global broadcast address which is the default, you should provide the IP address
//    of the Milight Controller for unicast mode. Don't use the global broadcast address on Windows as this may give
//    unexpected results. On Windows, global broadcast packets will only be routed via the first network adapter. If
//    you want to use a broadcast address though, use a network-specific address, e.g. for `192.168.0.1/24` use
//    `192.168.0.255`.
